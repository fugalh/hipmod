hipmod combines the simplicity of the Hipster PDA[1], the beauty of the D*I*Y
Planner[2], and the cleverness of the pocketmod[3] into one excuse-free PDA.

Usage
-----
Choose the 8 pages out of core.pdf which you would like to use, and create the
hipmod with a command like the following:

    ./hipmod -page 86,26,46,26,46,82,84,89 core.pdf

The result will be in core-up.pdf. If you have an 8-page PDF, you can simply
run this command to impose it:

    ./hipmod master.pdf

Again, the result is in master-up.pdf. You can bring any PDF to the party, by
first merging with core, e.g.:

    ./multivalent merge -append core.pdf circle_of_fifths.pdf

See pocketmod.com for instructions on folding your hipmod.

Requirements
------------
You need Java and a bourne shell. The Multivalent jar is included.
